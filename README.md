# Live_Face_Recog_Attendance
LIVE FACE RECOGNITION ATTENDANCE SYSTEM
CIE Hackathon Project – TECH TITANS

Hey reader,

This repository contains the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of our CIE Hackathon project titled Live Face Recognition Attendance System.

We are TECH TITANS, a group of students who worked on this project with the aim of solving a real and commonly faced problem in classrooms — proxy attendance.

Problem Statement

Most existing attendance systems such as manual roll calls, QR-based systems, or image-based verification are either time-consuming or easy to exploit.
Students can mark proxy attendance by sharing QR codes, screenshots, or images, which defeats the purpose of attendance tracking.

Our objective was to design a simple, automated system that verifies attendance using a live camera feed, making proxy attendance significantly harder.

Aim of the Project

The main aims of this project are:

To automate the attendance process

To reduce human involvement in attendance taking

To prevent proxy attendance

To verify students using live face input

To maintain a basic and reliable attendance record

Project Overview

The system uses a camera to capture a live video feed during attendance.
Faces detected in the frame are compared with previously registered face data.
Attendance is marked only when a match is found from a live feed, not from images or screenshots.

This project focuses on demonstrating the core idea rather than building a complete production-ready system.

Features Implemented in the MVP

Live face detection through camera input

Face matching with registered data

Automatic attendance marking

Basic structure for attendance storage

Simple and understandable project flow suitable for demonstration

Project Status

This project represents an MVP developed during a hackathon, with limited time and resources.

Core logic is implemented and functional

Focus is on concept validation and working demo

UI, scalability, and optimizations are not the primary focus in this version

Future Scope

The following features are planned for future versions of the project:

Anti-spoofing and liveness detection (blink detection, movement checks)

Improved accuracy and performance

Database integration for long-term storage

Admin dashboard for attendance management

Exporting attendance reports (CSV/Excel)

Cloud deployment

Integration with college ERP or LMS systems

Better user interface and authentication system
