# Live_Face_Recog_Attendance
Live Face Recognition Attendance System is a CIE hackathon MVP built to automate classroom attendance using real-time face verification. The project focuses on reducing proxy attendance by validating students through a live camera feed and demonstrating a practical, working concept rather than a full-scale system.
